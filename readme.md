## E-Commerce Project - Laravel API & Nuxt.js Front-End
<p>
  An E-Commerce project using Laravel in API mode instead of web driver mode.  Created a REST API using Laravel in API mode (instead of web driver mode), Axios to handle requests, Nuxt.js to handle the client front-end which uses JSON received from the API requests and responses to populate the client from the database using the API.
